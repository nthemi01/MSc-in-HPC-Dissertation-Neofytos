\section{FastJet in the future}

What is likely to change in the near future at experimental particle physics?

More events? More particle per event? More energetic particles?  

Future of experimental particle physics

The same number of proton bunches will be colliding

Each bunch will contain more protons though.

Each event is two bunches colliding. Not two proton.

This means, in the future, we will have the same number of events, but more output particles per event.

Due to having more kinetic energy, the boosted particles will be harder to tag.

Harder to parallelise, because all the jets will be on top of each other. 

Also more particles means that another strategy will be used.
